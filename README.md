## Overview

I opted to do this with native CSS and vanilla JavaScript for the fun of it. However the design of it really lends itself to react since its a very repeated pattern with only config changes.
### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Switch between viewing Daily, Weekly, and Monthly stats

Extra Credit:
- Implement a tablet layout

This was actually my first time using grid. While it offers a lot of neat features I think I prefer using Flexbox to organize things.
